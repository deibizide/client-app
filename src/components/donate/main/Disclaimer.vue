                Healthy Minds Initiative is built around an innovative approach to prevention that allows us to fight
                diseases and disorders of the brain at a local, national and global level.
            </p>
            <p class="pb-4">
                We start at a local level and determine what specific issues each community faces. By continuing to
                expand our outreach and data sets, we begin to learn the variables that make each community unique. This
                informs the preventative approach needed for the exact issues plaguing these communities.
            </p>
            <p class="pb-4">
                Next, we involve the community during the research and interventional stages. Community participation is
                crucial throughout the project in order to affect positive and lasting behavioural change.
            </p>
            <p class="pb-4">
                Case studies are then created, results are evaluated, and data is shared across our vast and growing
                research network.
            </p>
            <p class="pb-4">
                The final step in the process is to translate the science into practical, actionable items. Here we use
                technology to disseminate this knowledge across new communities.
            </p>
            <p class="pb-4">
                By scaling our web platform and investing in new outreach initiatives we are able to put our results in
                the spotlight and drive the brain health revolution forward - all while maintaining low overhead
                operating costs and offering increasingly detailed transparency.
