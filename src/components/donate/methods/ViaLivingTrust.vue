                    Naming Healthy Minds Initiative as a beneficiary of your living trust ensures your ongoing support
                    for nutrition research. Unlike a will, a living trust takes effect immediately upon your passing and
                    is also revocable.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In order to name Healthy Minds Initiative as a trustee, you must transfer ownership of specified
                    assets from your name to Healthy Minds Initiative. You will have use of all of these assets while
                    knowing that they will someday support a worthy cause. When filling out the legal documents with
                    your attorney, please use this material:
