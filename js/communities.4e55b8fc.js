Surrounding areas also have large tribal populations. With the high population of seniors, Alzheimer’s and other dementias are the dominant mind related health issues. HMI’s mission in Sedona and Northern Arizona will be focused around prevention of Alzheimer’s and other dementias - even possible reversal of mild cognitive impairment. Together we will build community awareness and develop support among community leaders and healthcare organizations. Down the line we would also like to address the interrelated issues of Depression, Substance Abuse and Suicide which are also higher than both the national and state wide averages.
